Testing Gravity returns to SFU Harbour Centre January 18-21, 2023, following a pause due to the COVID pandemic. Testing Gravity 2023 (TG2023) will be the 4th Testing Gravity conference hosted in-person by SFU, bringing together leading experts on various ways of testing laws of gravity. Testing Gravity remains a topical theme because of the unexplained nature of dark matter and dark energy and the long-standing failure to reconcile gravity with quantum physics. Like the <a href="../TestingGravity2015/">2015</a>, <a href="../TestingGravity2017/">2017</a> and <a href="../TestingGravity2019/">2019</a> meetings, TG2023 will feature latest updates from gravitational wave and astrophysical observatories, lab-based experiments, as well as discussions of recent theoretical advances. The conference aims to provide theorists working on extensions of General Relativity with a realistic perspective on what aspects of their theories can be tested. On the other hand, the experimentalists and observers will get a chance to learn about new ideas that their experiments can test.

Wednesday, January 18th, will feature a "school" with five review lectures given by some of the invited speakers providing background into the key topics covered by the conference. The main conference, January 19-21, will include invited and contributed talks, and a poster session.
